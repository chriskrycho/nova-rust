# Rust Extension for the Nova Text Editor

This project brings [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) support to the [Nova text editor](https://nova.app/) (macOS only). It is written in TypeScript for static typing, but transpiled to run in the macOS JavaScript environment using [Nova's API](https://docs.nova.app/) for extensions. This extension provides Rust developers with syntax highlighting, assistance from the Rust Analyzer language server, error checking, and automatic formatting.

## Users

Nova users can install this extension from Nova's [Extension Library](https://extensions.panic.com/), available within the app. More information for users is available in the [extension details](https://github.com.chriskrycho/nova-rust/blob/main/Rust.novaextension/README.md).

## Developers

See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for details on building the app and [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidance on interacting with the open source project.
