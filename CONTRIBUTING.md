# Contributing to This Project

You're interested in making this project better? Thank you! Below are some ways to make me really appreciate your contributions.

## Issues

- Please use an issue template if appropriate.
- Please be as descriptive as you can. It'll save us both time on follow-up questions.

## Pull Requests

My biggest request for pull requests is that they address a single concern. That could mean a single feature, or a single file of configuration parameters. Please make it manageable for me to review your changes.

## Commits

This project roughly follows by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). I appreciate this format for making it easier to follow development when scanning commit logs. If you don't follow this style, there's a greater chance your commits will get squash merged.

Related to my general request that pull requests are limited in scope, please also don't make massive commits. Keep the line count manageable so I can follow what you're changing.
