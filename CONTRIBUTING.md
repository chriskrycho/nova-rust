# Contributing to This Project

You're interested in making this project better? Thank you! Below are some ways to make me really appreciate your contributions.

## Adminstrative details

### Issues

- Please use an issue template if appropriate.
- Please be as descriptive as you can. It'll save us both time on follow-up questions.

### Pull Requests

My biggest request for pull requests is that they address a single concern. That could mean a single feature, or a single file of configuration parameters. Please make it manageable for me to review your changes.

### Commits

I am in the habit of using a loose version of the [Angular commit message style guide](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit), which has lately been subsumed by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). I appreciate this format for making it easier to follow development when scanning commit logs. If you don't follow this style, there's a greater chance your commits will get squash merged.

Related to my general request that pull requests are limited in scope, please also don't make massive commits. Keep the line count manageable so I can follow what you're changing.

## Building the project

> [!NOTE]
> These are minimal; I hope to expand them over time, but theyâ€™re enough to get by with for now.

Build the TypeScript files:

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm build`

Build the Tree-sitter grammar etc.:

- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`
- `cd tree-sitter`
- `./compile_parser.sh ./tree-sitter-rust <path to Nova.app>`
- `mv libtree-sitter-rust.dylib ../Rust.novaextension/Syntaxes/`
