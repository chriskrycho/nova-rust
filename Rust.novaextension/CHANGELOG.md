## Version 1.0.4

### Fixed

- Syntax fixes for impl and struct blocks

## Version 1.0.3

### Fixed

- Runs `rustfmt` from the project directory so that it picks up the `rustfmt.toml` I recommended you have. Oops.
- Those Rustfmt failure notifications were annoying, weren't they? Sorry about that.

## Versions 1.0.1 & 1.0.2

- Better checking that Rust Analyzer binary was downloaded.
